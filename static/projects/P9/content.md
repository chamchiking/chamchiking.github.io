### Overview

In this project, I developed a high-speed DVS based camera with Samsung's RC1s DVS chip.

We used the Infineon CX3 USB 3.1 Gen 1 controller (EZ-USBâ„¢ CX3 MIPI CSI-2 to USB 5Gbps camera controller) to interface between the DVS and the host system, acting as a MIPI-to-USB bridge.
I designed the whole system starting from camera PCB design, firmware code in the MIPI to USB 3.0 chip which supports 4 Gbps MIPI D-PHY, and the host application that can stream up to 1,000 fps DVS frames.
I implemented the firmware in C++ using a real-time operating system (RTOS) to remove the frame drops in the system, managing MIPI stream decoding, packetization, and USB communication.
On the host side, I developed a USB receiver application in C++ and Python using libusb, which performs real-time decoding of DVS event packets and streams them to the visualization pipeline.
