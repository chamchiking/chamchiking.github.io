This project focused on implementing Test-Driven Development (TDD) to improve server stability during significant architectural changes.<br>

The work involved drafting extensible test structures and examples using pytest to minimize errors during migration to a microservices-based system.<br>

Additionally, existing codebases were supplemented with test cases, which streamlined the QA process and facilitated automated reliability checks, expediting planned server expansion and stabilization efforts.<br>
