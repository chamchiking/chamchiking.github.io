This study presents a daily surveillance system based on dynamic vision sensors (DVS) and CMOS image sensors (CIS) to enable real-time image recognition with low energy consumption. In such a system, a neural processing unit (NPU) - which executes a DNN model to detect objects on a given CIS image - may consume a lot of energy when always-on. To address the problem, this work introduces a system with a DVS-based region of interest (ROI) detector and an event-based NPU trigger for energy savings. Based on DVS, the ROI detector effectively recognizes scene changes in dynamic environments, e.g., low-light scenes at midnight, which serves as a trigger to invoke the NPU for object detection. Our system prototype was built on a host PC and two Xilinx Zynq+ ZCU106 FPGA boards, one for the DVS-CIS receiver and the other for our NPU. The experimental results demonstrated that Over a 24-hour testing period, our system achieved a 31.5% reduction in energy usage. Operating a YOLOv3-Tiny object detector at 200 MHz, our NPU achieves a latency of just 18 ms, enabling seamless real-time monitoring capabilities
