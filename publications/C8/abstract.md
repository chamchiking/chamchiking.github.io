This demonstration presents a high-speed, energyefficient sensor fusion system integrating CMOS Image Sensors (CIS) and Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) for advanced image recognition. Using CIS for high-res imaging and DVS for rapid event-driven capture, the FPGA-implemented architecture with an NPU running YOLOv3-Tiny achieves 18 ms inference latency with a minimal 2.78% mAP loss. Selective NPU activation based on DVS-detected regions yielded 31.5% power savings, while a custom receiver module efficiently fused DVS (13,900 fps) and CIS (60 fps) data. The system uses a power of 6.977 W on a Xilinx Zynq+ ZCU106 board.
