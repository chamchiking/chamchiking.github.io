      "longDescription": "This project focused on creating a deep learning model capable of recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) on Nvidia's Jetson board. The solution included two primary components: data generation and model training. Data generation involved processing input images from A to Z using Mediapipe to extract 20 hand landmarks. The coordinates were normalized relative to the wrist base point and stored as lists. The recognition model utilized three fully connected layers to classify the 20 sets of x, y, z coordinates into 26 alphabets with 98.7% accuracy.",
