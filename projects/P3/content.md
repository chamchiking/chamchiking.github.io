This project involved designing three modules for VGG16 hardware: convolution, fully connected, and pooling, using Verilog.<br>

After implementing and deploying them on FPGA, the team explored performance enhancement strategies. Transitioning the fully connected module to a Systolic Array-based approach significantly improved performance.<br>

The project provided insights into efficient matrix multiplication techniques and hardware optimization.<br>
